# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹
My name is Corsin, I live in Switzerland and I like everything software related. Im currently an apprentice.
I have alot of Repos that are not finished or not even started. I will start developing ![PepeChat](https://github.com/C0RR1T/PepeChat) when I have enough experience in Spring Boot. Im more of a backend guy, so I really don't like anything design related (CSS, Bootstrap, Sass (Sass > CSS)). I've been a DogeHouse contributer, but unfortunately, the project has been stopped.  
# Used Languages
I've used some programming languages as listed:
<ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>Typescript / JavaScript</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Rust (no real experience)</li>
  <li>Haskell (I've used it but I have no experience in it)</li>
</ul>
I like to code in TypeScript because of the "freedom" you have. I also like to code in Java, but only if I use it together with Spring Boot.
