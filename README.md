# Hello everyone 👋
My name is Corsin, I live in Switzerland and I like everything software related. Im currently an apprentice.
Im currently developing the [Wisliger Casino](https://github.com/wisliger-casino). Im more of a backend guy, so I really don't like anything design related (CSS, Bootstrap, Sass (Sass > CSS)). I've been a DogeHouse contributer, but unfortunately, the project has been stopped.  
# Used Languages
I've used some programming languages as listed:

  * Java
  * Typescript / JavaScript
  * SQL
  * Rust
  * Haskell (I've used it but I have no idea what's going on)


I like to code in TypeScript because of the "freedom" you have. I also like to code in Java, but only if I use it together with Spring Boot. 

I have a meme that describes me pretty well (thanks [nils](https://github.com/Nilstrieb)): \
